- **70+ Skills Ecosystem**: 7 built-in + 63 custom skills — weather, GitHub, Slack, Notion, Spotify, Discord, and more. Plus 5,700+ ClaHub community skills.
- **Voice Conversations**: Ask via voice, get spoken responses. The AI avatar answers naturally with lip-synced animations. 5 TTS providers + STT.
- **Tool Execution**: File editing, terminal commands, web search. The AI avatar calls tools directly to get work done.
