This tab manages all agents (including the main AI 아바타) and sub-agents running within Naia OS.

## Agent List
- You can view a list of all currently active agent cards.
- When a complex task is initiated, AI 아바타 may spawn background sub-agents to process tasks in parallel.

## File Management
Clicking the **Files** button at the bottom of an agent card displays the list of files generated in that agent's local workspace.

- **Read File**: Click a file from the list to view its contents in the text area.
- **Edit File**: You can edit the content within the text area and click **Save** to update the file immediately.

## Session Management
You can also manage the active conversation sessions for these agents.
- **Delete**: Remove unnecessary sessions.
- **Compact**: Summarize very long session histories to free up system memory.
