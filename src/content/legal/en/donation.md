Naia OS is an open-source project under a dual license: **Apache 2.0** (source code) + **CC-BY-SA 4.0** (AI context).

## Why Donate?

Open source enabled vibe coding, but vibe coding must not destroy the open source ecosystem that made it possible.

In an era where AI generates code at scale, **AI context** (the .agents/ directory) — project philosophy, architecture, and contribution rules — is an asset as valuable as code itself. Naia OS shares this AI context as open source while working to build a sustainable model.

## When Your Support Helps

- You forked Naia OS for your own project
- You referenced the AI context structure (.agents/, .users/, AGENTS.md) for your own project
- You resonate with the dual-license model or philosophy
- You want to contribute to the sustainability of the open-source AI ecosystem

Even if you only "referenced" rather than directly copied, a small donation helps sustain the open source ecosystem.

## Nextain's Vision

> An architecture where AI agents themselves attribute sources, suggest voluntary donations, and sustain the open source ecosystem — this is our vision for a sustainable AI era.

Thank you.
